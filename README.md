Encrypting and Decrypting files using AES algorithm and location (latitude and longitude) as key.

AES algorithm is implemented without using any modules. The key which is used for encrypting and decrypting of data is generated from the python code ‘key generation for location’. Python module geopy.geocoders is used for this purpose. Any location (a city or state or country) is entered as the input and an output is generated based on the latitude and longitude of the location. This output is used as the key for the AES algorithm.
